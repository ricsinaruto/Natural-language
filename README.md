# Natural-language-projects

Here you can find my early project in which I wanted to create a chatbot before knowing anything about deep learning or NLP. I implemented several n-gram (without knowledge of the concept of an n-gram) extraction algorithms from text files. After which I combined the data into a final program where I planned to make my chatbot, but unfortunately I only got to implement a bigram based language generator. All the projects are in C++, compiled with Visual Studio.

### Natual_Language
In this folder I made a random text generator as a basic model for a chatting program.
### Natural_Language_the_program
This is the main program where you can try out the bigram based language generator. It loads all the n-gram data first so it takes a while to start up.
### Natural_Language_word
Here I created a program that will make google searches based on the most common words and return the number of results found.
### Natural_Language_gutenberg
This is similar to the previous program, but here I searched through text from the Gutenberg project.
### Natural_Language_textekkel, Natural_Language_textekkel_negyesRelaciok, Natural_Language_textekkel_otosRelaciok
These folders contain programs that will extract n-gram data from text files.
