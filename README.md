Natural language projects, mainly just word counting and sorting algorithms  
  
Natural_Language_the_program is the main program.  
This will generate some text based on my own bi-grams. The project is far from finished, there should be an option to use higher n-grams.
  
  The other folders are just for collecting data and extracting n-grams
